# Soulkeep

Soulkeep turns ListenBrainz `.jspf` playlists into clean music folders using Soulseek and `slskd`.

It is useful for self-hosted music libraries, Jellyfin setups, and local music collections. You give Soulkeep a JSPF playlist, it asks `slskd` to find and download matching MP3 files, verifies what actually appeared on disk, then creates a clean final folder with stable filenames and clean metadata.

> Use Soulkeep only with music you are legally allowed to download, store, and play.

```text
ListenBrainz JSPF playlist
        ↓
Soulkeep
        ↓
slskd / Soulseek downloads
        ↓
Clean final music folder
```

Example output:

```text
001 - Artist - Song Title.mp3
002 - Artist - Another Song.mp3
003 - Artist - Third Song.mp3
```



## Features

* Reads ListenBrainz `.jspf` playlists
* Preserves the original playlist order
* Searches tracks through the `slskd` API
* Filters bad Soulseek results
* Prefers usable MP3 files
* Retries multiple candidates when users reject, timeout, or disconnect
* Verifies that a downloaded file really appeared on disk
* Moves only verified files into the final folder
* Keeps late, failed, fuzzy, or unmatched candidates out of the final library
* Renames files into stable numbered filenames
* Cleans old ID3 metadata
* Writes fresh title, artist, album, album artist, and track number tags
* Supports artwork handling depending on the script version
* Works locally, on a Linux server, or in a CasaOS-style self-hosted setup

The most important behavior:

```text
Only verified manifest files are moved into the final music folder.
```

This protects your final library from duplicate files, bad fuzzy matches, late Soulseek downloads, and random leftovers.



## Requirements

* Node.js 18 or newer
* npm
* ffmpeg
* A running `slskd` instance
* A slskd API key
* A `.jspf` playlist
* A folder where `slskd` saves completed downloads
* A final music folder for Jellyfin or another music player



## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soulkeep.git
cd soulkeep
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
SLSKD_API_URL=http://localhost:5030/api/v0
SLSKD_API_KEY=YOUR_SLSKD_API_KEY
SLSKD_DOWNLOADS_PATH=./downloads
FINAL_MUSIC_PATH=./music
```

Make sure `slskd` is already running.

Run:

```bash
npm start
```

Or pass a playlist manually:

```bash
node src/download-jspf.mjs "/path/to/playlist.jspf"
```
